//! Spectral amplitude reconstruction (TIA-102.BABA_2003.pdf section 6.4, Eq. 67-79) -- the decoder-
//! side inverse of [`super::quantize`]'s block partitioning/DCT/quantization (Eq. 58-63) and
//! [`super::tables::quantize_gain_index`]'s gain index, plus [`super::prediction`]'s own Eq. 75-79
//! reassembly. This is the piece [`super::prediction`]'s own doc comment names as still missing: a
//! real closed-loop predictive coder must predict the next frame from what the decoder will actually
//! reconstruct, not from an encoder's own unquantized estimate -- [`reconstruct_spectral_amplitudes`]
//! below is what `mod.rs`'s `encode_frame` calls to produce that real history for the *next* frame.
//!
//! Transcribed from a 600 DPI render of TIA-102.BABA_2003.pdf pages 48-51 (section 6.4), following
//! the same discipline as every other body-text equation in this spec (Type3 digit font defeats
//! `pdftotext`).
//!
//! **The inverse DCT's own `alpha(k)` normalization (Eq. 70/74) was verified numerically before being
//! trusted, not just transcribed**: [`super::gain_vector_dct`]/[`super::quantize::block_dct`]'s own
//! forward transform uses a uniform `1/N` scaling for every coefficient (not the usual DCT-II
//! convention of a different scale for the DC term), so a real risk existed that Eq. 70/74's `alpha(1)
//! = 1, alpha(otherwise) = 2` inverse wouldn't actually invert it exactly. Checked with a real
//! numeric round trip (random inputs, `N` in `{3, 5, 6, 10}`) before writing any of the functions
//! below: forward-then-inverse reproduces the original input to within `1e-14`, confirming this is
//! the exact matching inverse, not merely a plausible-looking one.
