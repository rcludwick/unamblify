//! AMBE (Advanced Multi-Band Excitation) vocoder -- D-STAR's own generation of the algorithm,
//! implemented from TIA-102.BABA (the 2003 base standard) directly, per
//! `docs/proposals/AMBE_CODEC_AND_DSTAR_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`. DMR and Yaesu System Fusion both
//! use the later AMBE+2 generation (the 2009 half-rate addendum, which names 12 specific patents);
//! that generation is now implemented at `super::ambe_plus_2`, gated behind the `ambe_plus_2`
//! Cargo feature (off by default) for internal chip-compatibility testing only -- see
//! `AMBE_PLUS_2_NOTES.md` in this same directory for the authorization history and
//! `super::ambe_plus_2`'s own doc comment for the real implementation. Real deployment/default-on
//! use of that generation still needs the patent-clearance question resolved separately.
//!
//! # Real, current state, corrected 2026-09-07: both encode AND decode are now implemented, tested, and wired end to end
//!
//! **Stale as of this correction**: this section used to say "What remains: the entire decoder side
//! proper... remains genuinely unstarted." That was true when written but hadn't been updated since
//! -- the decoder side is real, complete, and tested: [`decode::DecoderState::decode_frame`] is the
//! real inverse of [`encode_frame`], covering frame-repeat robustness (section 7.7, Eq. 97-104),
//! mute/comfort-noise generation (section 7.8, real uniform-on-`[-5,5]` noise per the spec's own
//! literal text), spectral enhancement ([`enhancement`], sections 8-9), and the actual synthesis
//! filterbank ([`synthesis`], [`voiced_synthesis`], [`unvoiced_synthesis`]) that turns reconstructed
//! parameters back into real 20ms PCM. [`interleave::deinterleave_from_dibit_symbols`] is verified,
//! end to end, as the real inverse of [`interleave::interleave_to_dibit_symbols`] feeding straight
//! into `decode_parameters` -- not just checked in isolation against the raw bit-position math, per
//! `decode.rs`'s own `decode_parameters_agrees_whether_fed_c_directly_or_via_a_real_interleave_
//! deinterleave_round_trip` test.
//!
//! Every stage of section 5-7's own encode pipeline is implemented and tested (see the pipeline
//! list below), and [`encode_frame`] composes all eight of them into one real function that takes
//! an analysis frame and estimated pitch in and returns the final 144-bit modulated code vectors --
//! not just independently-tested pieces left for a caller to assemble correctly. It also closes the
//! gap an earlier version of this module disclosed as still open: `encode_frame` now runs its own
//! quantizer values back through [`reconstruct::reconstruct_spectral_amplitudes`] (dequantization
//! and the inverse DCTs, section 6.4) to produce real decoder-equivalent history for the *next*
//! frame's own prediction, rather than reusing this frame's own unquantized estimate. What already
//! exists: the frame structure and pipeline stage documentation below, `fec.rs`'s
//! Golay/Hamming FEC
//! (generator matrices independently verified two ways -- against each code's own published weight
//! distribution, and against the PDF's own separate vector-text layer, see that module's doc comment),
//! and `tables.rs`'s Annexes E, F, G, and J (gain quantizer levels, gain-vector bit allocation/step
//! size, higher-order DCT coefficient bit allocation, and prediction-residual block lengths) --
//! parsed programmatically from the real PDF (confirmed real vector text throughout, not a raster,
//! via `pdfimages -list` finding zero embedded images on any of these pages) and checked against real
//! structural invariants before being trusted, never read digit-by-digit by eye and taken on faith.
//!
//! **Annex G was the hard one, and needed a materially different technique than E/F/J**: `pdftotext`
//! garbles or drops entries on 31 of its 48 rows (a much bigger watermark-collision problem than
//! Annex F's 4 affected rows, and often 2-3 entries missing per row rather than 1, which defeated
//! Annex F's simpler "recover by elimination" fix). Resolved instead by extracting the PDF's raw
//! per-character glyph stream directly (bypassing `pdftotext`'s line-reconstruction heuristic
//! entirely) and reading each entry's actual coefficient-index label rather than inferring position
//! from layout -- see `tables.rs`'s own `higher_order_bit_allocation` doc comment for the full
//! methodology and its three-way independent verification (zero mismatches against all 1207 values
//! `pdftotext` DID get right; the real, per-block non-increasing bit-allocation invariant holding
//! with zero exceptions across all 288 blocks; and exact `L-6` entry counts with no gaps or
//! duplicates for all 48 `L` values). All four Annex tables are now real, verified, and available for
//! whatever encoder/decoder logic gets built against them next.
//!
//! # The encode pipeline, per TIA-102.BABA sections 5-7 -- now fully implemented
//!
//! 1. **Pitch estimation and voicing decision** (section 5.1, [`pitch`]/[`pitch_refinement`]; section
//!    5.2, Eq. 31-42, [`vuv`]): the fundamental frequency and a per-band voiced/unvoiced decision.
//! 2. **Spectral amplitude estimation** (section 5.3, Eq. 43-44, [`spectral_amplitude`]): each
//!    harmonic's own magnitude `M_hat_l`, voiced or unvoiced per [`vuv`]'s own decision.
//! 3. **Fundamental frequency and V/UV bit encoding** (section 6.1-6.2, Eq. 45/49,
//!    [`parameter_encoding`]): `b_hat_0` and `b_hat_1`.
//! 4. **Prediction residual** (section 6.2, Eq. 52-57, [`prediction`]): the log2-domain differential
//!    encoding of the spectral amplitudes against the previous frame's own reconstructed history (a
//!    real, disclosed scope boundary: that history is taken as an external input, since it depends on
//!    a decoder-reconstruction loop this module doesn't build -- see `prediction`'s own doc comment).
//! 5. **Block DCT and quantization** (section 6.3, Eq. 58-63, [`quantize`], using [`tables`]'s
//!    Annexes E/F/G/J and [`gain_vector_dct`] below): the gain vector's first element (`b_hat_2`) via
//!    Annex E's 6-bit non-uniform quantizer, the remaining gain elements and higher-order DCT
//!    coefficients via uniform quantizers whose bit allocation and step size depend on `L_hat`
//!    (Annexes F and G, plus the small in-body Tables 3-4 for the higher-order step sizes).
//! 6. **Bit prioritization** (Fig. 22, [`bit_prioritization`]): `b_hat_0..b_hat_{L+2}` reordered by
//!    importance into eight bit vectors `u_hat_0..u_hat_7`.
//! 7. **Forward error correction** (Eq. 81-83, [`fec`]): `u_hat_0..u_hat_3` each get a `[23,12]`
//!    Golay code, `u_hat_4..u_hat_6` each get a `[15,11]` Hamming code, `u_hat_7` is left unprotected.
//! 8. **Bit modulation** (Eq. 84-94, [`modulation`]): each FEC code vector XORed with a data-dependent
//!    pseudo-random sequence, producing the final modulated code vectors `c_hat_0..c_hat_7` --
//!    [`encode_code_vectors`] below wires steps 6-8 together into one call.
//!
//! 9. **Intra-frame bit interleaving** (section 7.5, Annex H, [`interleave`]): rearranges
//!    `c_hat_0..c_hat_7`'s own 144 bits into 72 two-bit dibit symbols, spreading short error bursts
//!    across several different error-correction code words -- see this module's own "real scope
//!    boundary" note below for exactly what this does and doesn't cover.
//! 10. **Spectral amplitude reconstruction** (section 6.4, Eq. 67-79, [`reconstruct`]): the decoder-
//!     side inverse of stage 5 -- dequantization, inverse DCTs, and Eq. 75-79's own log2 reassembly --
//!     that produces real decoder-equivalent history for stage 4's *next* frame prediction, closing
//!     the loop a real closed-loop predictive coder needs (Fig. 16's own "Reconstruct" feedback
//!     block).
//! 11. **End-to-end composition** ([`encode_frame`]): wires stages 1-8 and 10 together into one call
//!     (stage 9's own interleaving is a separate, optional final step over `encode_frame`'s own
//!     output -- see [`interleave::interleave_to_dibit_symbols`]), carrying the per-frame state
//!     ([`FrameState`]) that Eq. 41's energy tracker and Eq. 54's prediction residual both genuinely
//!     need from the previous frame.
//!
//! **A real scope boundary, corrected once during this build rather than left wrong**: an earlier
//! version of this doc comment claimed "this document never defines a bit-interleaving permutation
//! of its own," reasoning from Annex K's own flow chart ("interleaved ... into Project 25 Frame
//! Structure") and the encryption section's own deferral to "the Project 25 Common Air Interface."
//! That claim was too broad -- section 7.5 and Annex H ("Bit Frame Format") DO fully define a real
//! intra-frame interleaving: the 144 bits across `c_hat_0..c_hat_7` rearranged into 72 two-bit dibit
//! symbols ([`interleave::interleave_to_dibit_symbols`]), verified as a real bijection over all 144
//! bit positions before being trusted (see that module's own doc comment). What section 7.5 actually
//! defers to the Project 25 Common Air Interface is narrower than "interleaving" as a whole: only
//! *where* those 72 already-interleaved symbols land inside an actual transmitted channel frame
//! (timing, sync patterns, other channel overhead) -- its own text says the symbols should be
//! "inserted into the Project 25 frame format beginning with symbol 0," which is placement, not
//! reordering. `c_hat_0..c_hat_7` (144 bits total: `4*23 + 3*15 + 7`, matching `FRAME_BITS`) and
//! their own interleaved-symbol form are both this codec's own real, complete output; only the actual
//! channel-frame placement remains a separate protocol layer's concern. The decoder side (synthesis,
//! frame-repeat/mute robustness, spectral enhancement) is complete too -- see this doc comment's own
//! "Real, current state" section above.
//!
//! # What's left, honestly: D-STAR's own framing, not this codec's core algorithm
//!
//! What this module does NOT cover, and what `AMBE_CODEC_AND_DSTAR_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`'s own
//! "Real next steps" still names as open: D-STAR's own protocol-level framing around this codec (its
//! header/slow-data structure, radio-ID fields, and wherever D-STAR's own channel format differs from
//! the Project 25 CAI this module's own `interleave` doc comment discusses) -- the same "core codec
//! vs. channel-frame placement" scope boundary already drawn above for P25, not yet drawn for D-STAR
//! specifically. Also open: real AMBE-chip bit-exact validation once Bruce's own hardware arrives
//! (the proposal's own item 3). The 2009 AMBE+2 addendum is no longer out of scope -- see
//! `super::ambe_plus_2` (gated behind the `ambe_plus_2` Cargo feature, off by default) and this
//! file's own opening paragraph.

    ///   stays bounded (observed in the 0.06-0.10 range, consistent with the ~0.07-0.09 true
    ///   unvoiced-noise-floor input for this stimulus) rather than diverging, so this reads as
