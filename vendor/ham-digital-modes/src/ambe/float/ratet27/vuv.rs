//! Voiced/unvoiced (V/UV) determination (TIA-102.BABA_2003.pdf section 5.2, Eq. 31-42) -- decides,
//! per frequency band, whether the current frame's speech spectrum is better explained by the
//! harmonic (voiced) model or not (unvoiced), reusing the same `S_w(m)` and synthetic-spectrum
//! machinery [`pitch_refinement`] already built for quarter-sample pitch refinement.
//!
//! All equations transcribed from a direct 600 DPI render of TIA-102.BABA_2003.pdf pages 33-35
//! (`pdftotext` garbles this section the same way it garbled Eq. 5 and 24-30 -- the base standard's
//! own custom Type3 digit font defeats plain text extraction for numeric literals throughout, not
//! just in the Annex tables), following the same discipline as `pitch.rs` and `pitch_refinement.rs`.
//!
//! # A real cross-reference oddity in the standard's own text, left as found
//!
//! The body text says "Due to the limits on `omega0_hat`, equation (37) confines `L_hat` to the
//! range 9 <= L_hat <= 56" -- but Eq. (37) in this same document is the V/UV threshold function
//! `Theta_xi`, not a constraint on `omega0_hat`; the range 9-56 is really a consequence of the
//! fundamental-frequency equation (`omega0 = 2*pi/P`) combined with Eq. 31 below, not of Eq. 37. This
//! looks like a genuine cross-reference slip in the standard itself (plausibly meant "equation (4)")
//! rather than a transcription error here -- the 9-56 bound itself is real and checked directly by
//! this module's own tests, only the equation number it's attributed to is suspect.
//!
//! # A second real oddity: Eq. 36's own denominator
//!
//! Eq. 35 (the per-band voicing measure for every band except the highest) divides by
//! `sum |S_w(m)|^2`. Eq. 36 (the highest band's own voicing measure) is textually identical except
//! the rendered denominator reads `sum |S_w(omega)|^2` -- a bare `omega` where every other instance
//! of this exact sum, in this equation and in Eq. 35, uses `m`. Re-rendered at 600 DPI and confirmed
//! this is really what the page shows, not an artifact of a lower-resolution extraction. Implemented
//! here as `S_w(m)` (matching Eq. 35 and this equation's own numerator, both indexed by `m`), on the
//! reading that this is a real, isolated typographical slip in the standard rather than a
//! substantively different quantity -- there is no other definition of a frequency-indexed `S_w(omega)`
//! anywhere in this document.
