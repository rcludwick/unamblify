//! Quantizer and bit-allocation tables from TIA-102.BABA_2003.pdf's Annexes E and J. Unlike
//! `fec.rs`'s Golay/Hamming matrices, these are plain decimal numbers and small integers in the
//! spec's own text -- confirmed real, extractable PDF text (not a scanned raster) via `pdfimages
//! -list` (zero embedded images on these pages) exactly the same way `fec.rs` confirmed it for the
//! FEC matrix pages, so there is no pixel-level ambiguity risk transcribing them the way a bit
//! matrix carries. Each table below was parsed programmatically from the real `pdftotext` output
//! (not read digit-by-digit by eye) and checked against a real structural invariant before being
//! trusted -- see each table's own doc comment for what was checked.

/// The 6-bit non-uniform quantizer for the gain vector's first element (`G_hat_1`, the overall

/// drops or garbles entries on 31 of the 48 rows (`ambe/mod.rs`'s own doc comment records this as
/// the reason Annex G was originally left deferred). Rather than guess at the missing entries,
/// extracted the PDF's raw per-character glyph stream directly (via PyMuPDF/`fitz`'s `rawdict`,
/// bypassing `pdftotext`'s own line-reconstruction heuristic entirely), which requires decoding this
/// document's custom Type 3 font encoding -- confirmed empirically against Annex E's own clean,
/// unambiguous index column (0-63) that the encoding is trivial: a control character with `ord(c)`
/// in 1..=9 represents that digit, and literal ASCII `'0'` represents zero. Applied that decoder to
/// every character in Annex G, filtered to the real content fonts (excluding the diagonal "Limited
/// Use Only" watermark, which uses a distinct `Arial` font entirely -- confirmed via `pdfimages
/// -list` finding zero embedded images on any of these pages, so watermark and content are both real
/// vector text on separate font/layer, not a raster collision), and read each entry's own `C_{i,k}`/
/// `b`-index subscript labels directly by character position rather than inferring order from page
/// layout (an earlier attempt assuming a fixed reading direction produced the right VALUES but a
/// scrambled order for larger `L`, since one page uses a different single-column layout than the
/// rest -- discovered and corrected by cross-checking against known values, not assumed correct).
