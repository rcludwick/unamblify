//! The real DVSI chip's FEC codes for RATET(27), determined directly by sampling the live chip's
//! own encoder output rather than by black-box bit-flip relational testing -- see
//! `ratet27_wire_format`'s module doc for why relational testing (this investigation's original
//! approach) hits a hard mathematical wall: any weight-3/weight-7 codeword relationship is
//! preserved by the whole automorphism group of the abstract code (order 20160 for Hamming(15,11),
//! roughly 10^7 for Golay(23,12)), so no amount of flip-sweep data can ever pin down which specific
//! physical bit is which codeword coordinate. The fix, per `AMBE_CHIP_VALIDATION_FINDINGS.md`'s
//! own record of this pivot: capture real chip frames directly (`examples/p25_ratet27_capture_*`,
//! ~2200 distinct frames across synthetic tones, noise at 8 amplitudes, and 16 seconds of real
//! recorded speech), deinterleave via [`super::ratet27_wire_format::natural_position`], and treat
//! each block's observed natural-order bit patterns as vectors in a GF(2) linear code -- their
//! **rank** and **row-reduced basis** directly give the real generator matrix, no permutation
//! puzzle involved.
//!
//! # Results
//!
//! - **`g0`, `g1`, `g2` (Golay(23,12))**: rank exactly 12 (matching a pure, unwhitened codeword,
//!   no extra data-dependent modulation mixed into the wire bits), and the row-reduced generator
//!   basis is **bit-for-bit identical** to [`super::fec::golay_encode`]'s own systematic
//!   construction -- same data/parity split, same bit order, same `fec.rs`'s own `GOLAY_PARITY`
//!   values in every one of 36 compared rows (12 rows x 3 blocks). This chip's real Golay code for
//!   these 3 blocks needs no new implementation at all: [`super::fec::golay_encode`] and
//!   [`super::fec::golay_decode`] apply directly to each block's 23 natural-order bits.
//! - **`u4`, `u5`, `u6` (Hamming(15,11))**: rank exactly 11 each, and all three blocks share one
//!   **identical** row-reduced generator basis (one FEC routine used 3 times, as expected) -- but
//!   this basis's parity submatrix is a *different*, though equally valid, assignment of the same
//!   11 nonzero 4-bit column values `fec.rs`'s own `HAMMING_PARITY` uses, in a different data-bit
//!   order. [`HAMMING_PARITY_CHIP`] below is that real, chip-derived table, validated against 32
//!   independently-obtained empirical weight-3 codeword relationships (18 through `u4`, 7 through
//!   `u5`, 7 through `u6`, from three separate anchor-bit sweeps run earlier in this investigation)
//!   with zero mismatches -- every single one of those 32 relationships holds exactly under this
//!   generator matrix.
//! - **`c7`**: rank exactly 7 (its full width) -- confirms these 7 bits are genuinely unprotected
//!   raw data, not run through any code at all, matching the DVSI manual's own description.
//! - **`g3`**: **its real (non-Golay) codeword space is now implemented, though its semantic
//!   content remains open.** Across ~3500 distinct captured frames spanning pure tones, 8 noise
//!   amplitudes, real recorded speech, DTMF, dual-tones, and chirps, `g3`'s observed wire bits
//!   plateau at GF(2) rank 8 (not the expected 12), with 4 of its 23 natural-order bits (offsets
//!   2-5) *provably* always 0 -- confirmed structurally (every one of [`G3_GENERATOR`]'s own 8
//!   basis rows is 0 at those positions, not merely unobserved-as-1 in the sample). Unlike
//!   `g0`-`g2`, `g3`'s independent bits are natural offsets `{0,1,6,7,8,9,10,11}`, not a
//!   contiguous systematic prefix. [`g3_encode`]/[`g3_decode`] implement this real, validated
//!   (every captured frame confirmed within its span) 8-bit codeword space -- a genuine software
//!   duplicate of `g3`'s actual behavior, even though *why* only 8 of its 12 nominal Golay data
//!   bits carry real information, or what real-world parameter this 8-bit subspace represents,
//!   remains unresolved (see `AMBE_CHIP_VALIDATION_FINDINGS.md` sections 23-29 for the full
//!   experimental record, including several tested-and-refuted semantic hypotheses).
