//! Unvoiced speech synthesis (TIA-102.BABA_2003.pdf section 11.2, Eq. 117-126) -- the noise-based
//! half of section 11's own speech synthesis (see [`super::mod`]'s own Fig. 26 doc comment for how
//! this combines with voiced synthesis). Produces `s_uv(n)`, a real 160-sample (`N`, 20 ms) PCM
//! contribution per frame, from the reconstructed/enhanced model parameters
//! ([`super::reconstruct`]/[`super::enhancement`]'s own output).
//!
//! Transcribed from a 600 DPI render of TIA-102.BABA_2003.pdf pages 74-75 (self-numbered 57-59) for
//! Eq. 117-126, plus Annex I (pages 111-112, self-numbered 95-96) for the synthesis window `w_S(n)`.
//!
//! **Independent cross-check against `kchmck/imbe.rs`'s own `unvoiced.rs`, with one deliberate,
//! documented deviation**: that crate does NOT implement Eq. 117's own deterministic noise recurrence
//! at all -- its own doc comment explains it substitutes a statistically-equivalent Gaussian random
//! generator instead, for real-time performance (avoiding an O(n) DFT of a literal noise sequence).
//! That is a legitimate engineering trade-off for a real-time decoder (the spec itself only says the
//! noise "can have an arbitrary mean," not that decoders must reproduce Eq. 117 bit-for-bit), but it
//! means this module's own choice to implement Eq. 117 literally is *not* redundant with anything
//! that crate already verified -- it remains its own from-scratch transcription. Everything else
//! (Eq. 120's own scaling, Eq. 121's own `gamma_w` numeric value, Eq. 122-123's own band edges, and
//! Eq. 126's own overlap-add) matches that crate's `edges`/`SCALING_COEF`/`Unvoiced::get` exactly.
