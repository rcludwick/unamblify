//! Top-level bitstream decoder: the real inverse of [`super::encode_frame`], turning a received
//! 144-bit frame (the eight code vectors `c_hat_0..c_hat_7`, or the 72 interleaved dibit symbols an
//! actual P25 channel decoder hands over -- [`super::interleave::deinterleave_from_dibit_symbols`]
//! is the bridge between the two) into a synthesized 20 ms PCM frame.
//!
//! # Decode order, and why it isn't just `encode_frame` run backwards field by field
//!
//! 1. **Golay-decode `c_hat_0`** to recover `u_hat_0` (never modulated) and its own corrected-error
//!    count `epsilon_0`.
//! 2. **FEC-decode `c_hat_1..c_hat_3` (Golay) and `c_hat_4..c_hat_6` (Hamming) directly** -- **no
//!    demodulation step**, despite the spec's own theoretical IMBE encoder describing one (this
//!    module used to call [`super::modulation::modulate_code_vectors`] here to undo it, matching
//!    [`super::encode_frame`]'s own former modulation step). `docs/references/
//!    AMBE_CHIP_VALIDATION_FINDINGS.md` section 23 already established, from direct GF(2) rank
//!    analysis of ~2200 real chip-captured frames, that these blocks reach full rank as *plain* FEC
//!    codewords on the real wire -- "the wire bits genuinely are the FEC codewords themselves," that
//!    finding's own words -- meaning the real DVSI chip never applies the spec's theoretical
//!    whitening/modulation stage at all. Demodulating here was silently corrupting
//!    `u_hat_1..u_hat_6` on every real frame (confirmed directly: live chip data showed the
//!    resulting `omega0_tilde`/per-harmonic voicing diverging substantially from real recorded
//!    speech's own expected behavior), while individual blocks still happened to FEC-decode
//!    "successfully" -- a modulated-then-corrected codeword still looks like a valid parameter set,
//!    just the wrong one, which is why this went undetected until PCM was compared against the
//!    chip's own decoded output for the first time. `nu_hat_7 = c_hat_7` (no FEC ever, unaffected
//!    either way). **`c_hat_4..c_hat_6` are decoded with the chip's own Hamming labeling
//!    ([`super::ratet27_fec::hamming_decode_chip`]), not the textbook one** -- section 23 of that same
//!    findings document had recorded the difference, but this decoder kept the textbook code until a live
//!    run showed it reporting false corrected errors in 576 of 600 clean chip Hamming words and recovering
//!    different data for 377 of them (`tests/ambe_ratet27_chip_hamming_labeling.rs`).
//! 3. Together with `epsilon_0`, the corrected-error counts from this step feed
//!    [`super::error_estimation::estimate_errors`].
//! 4. **Bootstrap `b_hat_0`** directly from `u_hat_0`/`u_hat_7` alone
//!    ([`super::bit_prioritization::extract_fundamental_frequency_quantizer`]) -- breaking the real
//!    chicken-and-egg problem [`super::bit_prioritization::deprioritize_bits`] can't solve on its own:
//!    that function needs `k_hat` and the Annex F/G column widths just to know where the bitstream
//!    splits, but `k_hat`/`L~` are only knowable *after* decoding `b_hat_0`.
//! 5. **Check for a mute or a frame repeat** -- section 7.8's own `epsilon_R > .0875` threshold
//!    first (checked independently and first, since it's a real, separate, stricter requirement:
//!    "the decoder is required to mute," not merely a worse repeat), then section 7.7 (Eq. 97-98
//!    plus an out-of-range `b_hat_0`) -- before doing any further, parameter-dependent decoding.
//! 6. If neither: dequantize `b_hat_0` into `omega0_tilde`/`L~`/`K~`, run the full
//!    [`super::bit_prioritization::deprioritize_bits`] now that `k_hat`/widths are known, decode the
//!    per-band V/UV bits into per-harmonic ones (Eq. 50-51), reconstruct the spectral amplitudes
//!    (section 6.4), and hand everything to [`super::synthesis::SynthesisState::synthesize_frame`].
//! 7. If repeating: skip straight to
//!    [`super::synthesis::SynthesisState::synthesize_repeated_frame`] (Eq. 99-104), and leave this
//!    decoder's own `l_hat_prev`/`spectral_amplitudes_prev` untouched (Eq. 100/103's own
//!    "current = previous" reduces to "don't reassign them" here).
//! 8. If muted: the same "don't reassign them" reasoning satisfies 7.8's own required "step (2)"
//!    parameter-copy update (confirmed directly from the spec's own text: 7.8 requires exactly the
//!    frame-repeat process's step (2), Eq. 99-104), but the actual output bypasses speech synthesis
//!    entirely -- [`super::synthesis::SynthesisState::synthesize_comfort_frame`] emits real,
//!    uniform-on-`[-5,5]` comfort noise per the spec's own literal Section 7.8 text, transcribed
//!    from a 600 DPI render of TIA-102.BABA_2003.pdf page 63.
