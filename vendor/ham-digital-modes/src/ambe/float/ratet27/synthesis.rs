//! Top-level decoder-side synthesis orchestration (TIA-102.BABA_2003.pdf sections 8-11 combined):
//! wires [`super::reconstruct::reconstruct_spectral_amplitudes`]'s own output through
//! [`super::enhancement`]'s three caller-applied steps -- spectral amplitude enhancement (Eq. 105-
//! 110), Eq. 113's own V/UV forcing, and Eq. 116's own final amplitude smoothing scale, all three
//! deliberately left for the caller by that module's own doc comment -- before handing the result to
//! [`super::unvoiced_synthesis`]/[`super::voiced_synthesis`] and summing per Eq. 142.
//!
//! **Why this module exists as its own thing, not just left to whatever eventually calls
//! `unvoiced_synthesis`/`voiced_synthesis` directly**: `enhance_spectral_amplitudes`'s own output is
//! *not* the `M_bar_l(0)` synthesis actually uses -- it still needs Eq. 113's voicing-forcing and
//! Eq. 116's smoothing scale applied on top of it, both of which carry their own frame-to-frame state
//! (`S_E`, Eq. 111, and `tau_M`, Eq. 115). Skipping either step compiles, runs, and produces
//! plausible-sounding output -- it's wrong in a way no unit test in either `enhancement.rs` or
//! `unvoiced_synthesis.rs`/`voiced_synthesis.rs` alone would ever catch, since each of those modules
//! is only tested against its own equations, not against the composition. This module's own job is
//! to make sure that composition happens in the one place a caller would otherwise be tempted to
//! skip a step.
