//! The real DVSI chip's P25 full-rate (`RATET` Rate Index 27, "APCO Project 25 with FEC") 144-bit
//! wire format, reverse-engineered by direct chip experiment against a real AMBE3003 -- this is a
//! **different, proprietary format from TIA-102.BABA_2003 Annex H** ([`super::interleave`], which
//! implements the *textbook* interleave and is confirmed NOT to match this chip's actual wire bytes;
//! see `docs/references/AMBE_CHIP_VALIDATION_FINDINGS.md` sections 15-22 for the full experimental
//! record this module is built from).
//!
//! # What is fully established (verified against the real chip, zero assumptions)
//!
//! 1. **The 12x12 block-interleave transform.** Wire (transmitted) bit position `m` (0..144)
//!    corresponds to natural (pre-interleave) position [`natural_position(m)`]. This is a matrix
//!    transpose -- write the natural bitstream down 12 columns, read it back out across 12 rows --
//!    and is self-inverse: applying the same formula to a natural position recovers the wire
//!    position. Confirmed by: mapping each of `u4`/`u5`/`u6`/`c7`'s independently, directly
//!    chip-confirmed wire memberships (found by pure black-box anchor sweeps, no interleave table
//!    assumed at all) through this formula and getting, every time, one contiguous natural range --
//!    see the `*_transforms_to_its_confirmed_natural_range` tests below, which check this against
//!    the literal wire-position sets recorded in the findings doc.
//!
//! 2. **The 8 sub-block natural order and boundaries.** The blocks are simply concatenated by
//!    decreasing error-protection strength: `g0..g3` (four Golay(23,12) blocks, natural 0-91),
//!    `u4..u6` (three Hamming(15,11) blocks, natural 92-136), `c7` (7 unprotected raw bits, natural
//!    137-143). This matches DVSI's own AMBE-3000R Vocoder Chip Users Manual (section 6.9), which
//!    states plainly that low-index bits are "the bits which are most sensitive to bit errors" and
//!    high-index bits "the bits which are least sensitive."
//!
//! 3. **[`block_wire_members`] gives every block's exact wire-bit membership**, computed directly
//!    from points 1+2 (not a separate hardcoded guess) -- and for `u4`/`u5`/`u6`/`c7` this exactly
//!    matches the independently, directly chip-confirmed sets (found with no interleave assumed at
//!    all), with zero mismatches. The 4 Golay blocks' *boundaries* were separately confirmed directly
//!    against the chip (in-block vs. straddling multi-bit-flip tests, section 21) but not walked
//!    bit-by-bit the way the 3 Hamming blocks were -- see the open item below.
//!
//! # What is NOT yet established (open, tracked in the findings doc)
//!
//! The exact bit-index-*within*-codeword permutation -- i.e. given a block's 15 (or 23, or 7) wire
//! bits in natural order, which specific position feeds [`super::fec::hamming_decode`]'s bit 14 vs
//! bit 3 vs bit 0, etc. -- is **not yet uniquely determined**. Black-box pairwise/triple bit-flip
//! experiments alone cannot fully pin this down: the Hamming(15,11) and Golay(23,12) codes' own
//! automorphism groups mean multiple distinct physical-bit-to-codeword-index permutations can
//! satisfy the same observed weight-3/weight-7 codeword relationships from a single anchor bit.
//! Resolving this needs constraints from multiple non-overlapping anchor bits (in progress -- see
//! the findings doc's second/third-anchor sweeps) or direct validation against real captured wire
//! frames. Until confirmed, do not trust decoded FEC data-bit *values* (actual voice-parameter
//! content) against the real chip -- only the block *membership* and *natural ordering* facts above
//! are chip-verified today. `g1`-`g3`'s bit-by-bit membership (as opposed to their confirmed
//! boundaries) is also not yet independently walked the way `u4`-`u6` and `g0` were.
