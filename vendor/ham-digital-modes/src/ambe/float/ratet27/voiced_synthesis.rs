//! Voiced speech synthesis (TIA-102.BABA_2003.pdf section 11.3, Eq. 127-141) -- the per-harmonic
//! sinusoidal half of section 11's own speech synthesis (see [`super::unvoiced_synthesis`]'s own doc
//! comment for how this combines with unvoiced synthesis via Eq. 142). Produces `s_v(n)`, a real
//! 160-sample (`N`, 20 ms) PCM contribution per frame, from the reconstructed/enhanced model
//! parameters ([`super::reconstruct`]/[`super::enhancement`]'s own output).
//!
//! Transcribed from a 600 DPI render of pages 76-78 (self-numbered 60-62) for Eq. 127-141, plus
//! Annex A (page 80, self-numbered 64) for every state variable's own real initial value.
//!
//! **A real notational ambiguity in the primary source, resolved and documented rather than
//! silently guessed at**: Eq. 140's own first branch condition is written as `1 <= l <=
//! floor(L~/4)` with a bare `L~` -- no explicit `(0)` or `(-1)` -- while the very same equation's
//! second branch divides by an explicit `L~(0)` two lines below it. Re-rendered at 600 DPI
//! specifically to rule out a dropped subscript (the same discipline used earlier this session for
//! the "symbol 1" oddity in Annex H): the glyph is a clean, complete `L~` with no truncation, so this
//! reads as the source's own abbreviated notation, not an extraction artifact. Given every other
//! frame-index omission in this section defaults to "current frame" (`(0)`) while `(-1)` is always
//! written explicitly, and the adjacent explicit `L~(0)` in the same equation, this module resolves
//! the bare `L~` as `L~(0)` -- documented here rather than left as a silent assumption.
//!
//! **What the spec leaves genuinely undefined, and this module's own resolution**: Eq. 140 only
//! defines `phi_l(0)` for `1 <= l <= max[L~(-1), L~(0)]`, but the spec's own text says `psi_l(0)`
//! "must be updated every frame ... for `1 <= l <= 56`, regardless of the value of `L~` or the value
//! of the V/UV decisions" -- meaning a harmonic beyond the currently active range still needs a
//! tracked phase for whenever it becomes active again, but Eq. 140 gives no formula for it. This
//! module extends Eq. 140's own first branch (`phi_l(0) = psi_l(0)`, no randomization) to every
//! `l > max[L~(-1), L~(0)]` too, on the reasoning that the randomization term exists specifically to
//! desynchronize the "sizzle" region for harmonics currently transitioning into or within active use,
//! not for tracking harmonics that aren't in play at all yet.
