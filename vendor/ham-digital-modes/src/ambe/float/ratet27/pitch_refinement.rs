//! Quarter-sample pitch refinement (TIA-102.BABA_2003.pdf section 5.1.5, Eq. 24-30) -- improves the
//! initial pitch estimate (`pitch::choose_initial_pitch_estimate`, half-sample accuracy) to
//! quarter-sample accuracy by comparing the real speech spectrum against a synthetic spectrum built
//! from estimated harmonic amplitudes, for ten fine-grained candidates around the initial estimate.
//!
//! All equations transcribed from a direct high-DPI render of the relevant page (the `pdftotext`
//! extraction of this section badly garbles the nested floor/ceiling notation in Eq. 24 and 28 --
//! cropped and re-rendered at 600 DPI to resolve it with certainty rather than guess at OCR
//! artifacts, the same discipline `pitch.rs`'s own Eq. 5 transcription used).
//!
//! A real simplification found directly in the spec's own text, not assumed: `W_R(m)` (Eq. 30, the
//! window's own DFT) is always real, since `w_R(n)` is a real, symmetric sequence -- the spec states
//! this explicitly ("since w_R(n) is a real symmetric sequence, W_R*(m) = W_R(m)"), which is only
//! possible for a value equal to its own complex conjugate. That means every place Eq. 28's own
//! `A_l(omega0)` formula multiplies or divides by `W_R`, it's a real scalar, not a complex one -- no
//! complex-times-complex multiplication is ever needed anywhere in this module, only complex-scaled-
//! by-real, so a minimal local complex type covering exactly that is enough; a general-purpose
//! complex-arithmetic crate would be solving a harder problem than this one actually has.
