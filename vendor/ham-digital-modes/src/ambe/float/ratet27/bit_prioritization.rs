//! Bit prioritization (TIA-102.BABA_2003.pdf section 7.1, Fig. 22): rearranges the quantizer values
//! `b_hat_0, b_hat_1, ..., b_hat_{L+1}, b_hat_{L+2}` into the eight prioritized bit vectors
//! `u_hat_0..u_hat_7` that [`super::fec`]'s Golay/Hamming codes protect (`u_0..u_3` at 12 bits each,
//! `u_4..u_6` at 11 bits each, `u_7` at 7 bits -- summing to `super::VOICE_BITS`, 88).
//!
//! Transcribed from a 600 DPI render of TIA-102.BABA_2003.pdf pages 53-55, following the same
//! discipline as every other body-text equation in this spec (Type3 digit font defeats
//! `pdftotext`) -- with one extra layer of care this section specifically needed, recorded below.
//!
//! # A real, caught-in-the-act pdftotext digit corruption, not just the usual garbling
//!
//! Page 54's own body text, extracted with plain `pdftotext`, reads: "The next bits to be inserted
//! into the bit vectors are all of the bits of `b_hat_1` ..., followed by bit 2 and then bit 1 of
//! `b_hat_2`". Read at face value this contradicts the *same page's own earlier paragraph*, which
//! already stated `u_hat_0`'s middle three bits come from "the three most significant bits of
//! `b_hat_2`" -- if true, `b_hat_1` would be quantizing something never assigned any bits at all
//! anywhere in this document, and `b_hat_2`'s top 3 bits would be assigned twice. Re-rendered that
//! earlier paragraph at 600 DPI specifically to check, and it actually reads "the three most
//! significant bits of **`b_hat_2`**" (not `b_hat_1` as an initial plain-text skim might suggest) --
//! `pdftotext`'s own digit-glyph reconstruction conflated the Type3 font's control-character
//! encodings for `1` and `2` in that one spot. With that resolved, the whole section is internally
//! consistent (verified below, not just asserted): `b_hat_0` contributes 8 bits total (6 up front,
//! 2 at the very end), `b_hat_2` contributes 6 bits total (3 up front, 2 in the middle, 1 near the
//! end), `b_hat_1` contributes all `K_hat` of its own bits in one place (the middle), and the
//! `b_hat_3..b_hat_{L+1}` raster scan (Fig. 22) contributes the rest -- summing to exactly
//! `VOICE_BITS` (88) for every real `(L, K_hat)` pair the codec produces, confirmed against the
//! actual worked example in Fig. 22 (`L_hat = 16`, `K_hat = 6`) bit for bit before writing any of the
//! code below, not merely by re-deriving the total count.
//!
//! # The raster scan itself (Fig. 22)
//!
//! `b_hat_3` through `b_hat_{L+1}` are drawn as columns of varying height (each column's height is
//! that value's own bit allocation, from Annex F for `b_hat_3..b_hat_7` and Annex G for
//! `b_hat_8..b_hat_{L+1}`), and are scanned in one continuous top-to-bottom, left-to-right order:
//! within each bit-significance level (starting from whatever the tallest column's own MSB is, down
//! to every column's shared LSB level 0), visit each column left to right and emit that column's own
//! bit at the current level if the column is tall enough to have one. A column with a `0`-bit
//! allocation (a real value in Annex G, see `super::tables`' own doc comment) contributes no cells at
//! all, which this scan handles for free -- it's simply never "tall enough" at any level.
//!
//! The resulting flat sequence of scanned bits is inserted continuously across two separate
//! destination spans (the first 39 bits fill the last 3 bits of `u_hat_0` plus all of `u_hat_1`
//! through `u_hat_3`; the remainder fills alongside `b_hat_1`/`b_hat_2` into `u_hat_4` through the
//! top of `u_hat_7`) -- but from the *source* side there is no seam: it's one uninterrupted scan,
//! which is why [`raster_scan_bits`] takes no notion of where the two spans divide.

/// Runs Fig. 22's own raster scan over `columns` (`(value, bit_width)` pairs for `b_hat_3` through
