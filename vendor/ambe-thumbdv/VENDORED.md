# Vendored: `ambe-thumbdv`

This directory is a **verbatim vendored copy** of the `ambe-thumbdv` crate — the
DVSI AMBE-3000 packet driver that talks to a ThumbDV / DV3000 USB dongle. It is
the hardware vocoder path for D-Star; nothing else in this repository can encode
or decode AMBE.

## Why it is vendored

The rest of this workspace is AGPL-3.0-only. `ambe-thumbdv` is dual MIT/Apache
and stays that way: it lives under `vendor/` rather than `crates/` so the
licence boundary is visible in the tree, and its `Cargo.toml` hard-codes
`license`, `version`, `edition` and `repository` instead of inheriting them from
the workspace — inheriting would resolve `license` to `AGPL-3.0-only` and
silently relicense someone else's terms.

Vendoring also removes the last `git = "https://github.com/rcludwick/ambe"`
dependency from the build, so a clean checkout builds fully offline.

In this repository the consumer is `crates/unamblify-data` (the capture
harness), as a plain path dependency:

```toml
ambe-thumbdv = { path = "../../vendor/ambe-thumbdv" }
```

The copy here is byte-identical to astar's `vendor/ambe-thumbdv` at the
revision above; when one is re-vendored, re-vendor the other.

## What is vendored, and only that

`src/` — the packet driver and its `thumbdv-rig` binary. Nothing else from
upstream is used: every AMBE encode and decode in this repository runs on the
dongle, and there is no software AMBE backend of any kind here.

## Updating

Copy `src/` from upstream verbatim, keep this file's revision row current, and
do **not** let the four hard-coded metadata keys revert to `.workspace = true`.
Local edits are discouraged — fix upstream and re-vendor, so the two copies do
not drift.
